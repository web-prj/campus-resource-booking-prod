# Frontend Design

Design and review this project as a USTH campus product, not as a generic landing-page template. Make deliberate choices about hierarchy, typography, layout, interaction, and content while preserving the established USTH identity and the user's requirements.

## Ground your designs in the subject matter

If the brief does not identify what the product or subject matter is, identify it yourself before designing, and confirm with the client. You can come up with one concrete subject, the design's audience, and the design's primary job, as a proposal. If there's any information in your memory about the client's preferences or context about what they're building, use that as a hint. The subject's industry, subject matter, materials, and vernacular are where distinctive visual choices come from — a design for a toy for girls aged 8–11 will be very aesthetically different from a dashboard for financial analysts. Build with the brief's real content and subject matter throughout.

## Project brand constraint: USTH

Treat the current USTH visual identity as a fixed requirement rather than an open design axis. Use only the verified core palette of USTH royal blue (`#2A3C95`), USTH red (`#EC2227`), and white as the brand foundation. Use darker or lighter tonal variants only when needed for hierarchy, contrast, states, or glassmorphism. Do not propose a replacement brand palette.

When reviewing or redesigning an existing USTH screen:
- Preserve recognizable USTH blue/red/white brand cues and assess whether they are applied with appropriate hierarchy and accessible contrast.
- Improve distinctiveness through campus-booking content, spatial composition, typography, resource imagery or diagrams, and interaction—not by inventing a different brand palette.
- Treat a user-specified visual treatment such as glassmorphism as part of the brief. Refine its opacity, blur, borders, and layering rather than rejecting it as a general design trend.
- Distinguish between a required brand choice and a generic implementation pattern. Critique repetitive cards, decorative gradients, labels, or motion without blaming the required USTH colors.
- If the official palette cannot satisfy a functional state by itself, add restrained semantic colors for success, warning, and error while keeping them subordinate to the brand.

## Design principles

For web designs, the hero is the first thing viewers will see. Open with the most characteristic thing in the subject's world, in the form that is most appropriate: a headline, an image, an animation, a live demo, an interactive moment, or other treatments. Be deliberate with your choice: a big number with a small label, supporting stats, and a gradient accent is the default treatment, so only use it if that's truly the best option.

Typography carries the personality of the page. You don't need a different typeface for display or headline text and body content: use one family or two, and if two, make them clearly distinct.

Choose your typefaces deliberately, not the default families you would reach for on any other project, and set a clear type scale following the default guidance of The Elements of Typographic Style with intentional weights, widths, and spacing. When type is used as a headline or visual element, use the type treatment itself as an active part of the design, not a neutral delivery vehicle for the content.

Default to line lengths of less than 80 characters. Serif typefaces can have slightly longer line lengths; give serif body text slightly more line-height than a sans-serif.

Avoid these default typographic treatments; they are the commonest tells of a generated page:
- Accenting just a single word or phrase in a headline, like putting one word in italic/bold or a different color.
- Using all caps for labels.
- Adding unnecessary typographic labels above content.

Visual structure is information. Structural devices like outlines, borders, numbering, eyebrows, dividers, labels, etc., encode useful information about the content rather than decorate it. Many generic designs use numbered markers (01 / 02 / 03), but that's only appropriate if the content actually is a sequence — like a stepped process or a timeline. Before adding numbered markers, check the content really is a sequence.

Use non-user-triggered motion sparingly and deliberately, only to draw attention. A single orchestrated moment — one page-load sequence or one reveal — lands better than scattered effects; fade-and-slide-up entrances on each section and hover transitions on every card are the generic default and read as AI-generated. Motion that answers a person's action (opening, expanding, confirming) is welcome when it shows what changed.

Consider written content carefully. Often a design brief may not contain real content, and it's up to you to come up with copy and placeholder content. Copy can make a design feel as templated as the design itself. See the below section on writing for more guidance.

## Process: plan, review against the brief, build, critique

Before building or approving a design, check for project-specificity rather than fashionable defaults:
1. The availability and booking experience should be the strongest visual idea, not generic marketing decoration.
2. Rooms, laboratories, equipment, buildings, capacity, approval rules, time slots, and booking states should appear as real interface content.
3. Glassmorphism should clarify hierarchy: one dominant glass surface, lighter supporting layers, and readable contrast. Do not apply identical glass cards to every section.
4. Repeated rounded cards, shadows, gradients, labels, and hover effects must communicate structure or interaction. Remove them when they are only decoration.
5. Numbering should represent a real sequence. Eyebrows, dividers, badges, and metadata should help users scan or act rather than fill empty space.
6. Mobile layouts should prioritize the primary task—signing in, searching, checking availability, or managing a booking—before promotional storytelling.

The user's brief is authoritative. Preserve its USTH identity and requested glassmorphism while using the remaining design freedom to improve campus specificity, hierarchy, usability, and restraint.

Work in two passes. First, brainstorm a short design plan based on the client's design brief: create a compact token system with color, type, layout, and principles.
- Color: when a brand palette is specified, preserve its verified core colors and define only the tonal or semantic extensions needed for contrast and interface states. For this project, begin with USTH blue `#2A3C95`, USTH red `#EC2227`, and white; do not propose a replacement palette.
- Type: the typefaces and their roles.
- Layout: a layout concept, using one-sentence prose descriptions and ASCII wireframes to ideate and compare. Include alignment guidance; should the content be left aligned, center aligned, justified?
- Principles: the high-level guidance for what makes this page unique.

Then review that plan against the brief before building: if any part of it reads like the generic default you would produce for any similar page (work through a similar prompt to see if you arrive somewhere similar) rather than a choice made for this specific brief — revise that part, say what you changed and why. Only after you've confirmed the relative uniqueness of your design plan should you start to write the code, following the revised plan.

When writing the code, be careful of structuring your CSS selector specificities. It's easy to generate CSS classes that cancel each other out (especially with a type-based selector like .section and an element-based selector like .cta). This can happen often with padding/margin between sections.

## Restraint and self-critique

Spend your boldness in one place. Let one element be the memorable thing, keep everything around it quiet and disciplined, and cut any decoration that does not serve the brief. Build to a quality floor without announcing it: responsive down to mobile, visible keyboard focus, reduced motion respected, visually accessible, harmonious color palettes. Critique your own work as you build, taking screenshots to review if your environment supports it — a picture is worth 1000 tokens. Consider Chanel's advice: before leaving the house, take a look in the mirror and remove one accessory. Human creatives have memory and always try to do something new, so if you have a space to quickly jot down notes about what you've tried, it can help you in future passes.

## More on writing in design

Words appear in a design for one reason: to make it easier to understand and use. They are design content, not decoration. Bring the same intentionality and minimalism to copywriting that you would bring to spacing and color. Before writing anything, ask what the design needs to say, and how it can best be said to help the person navigate the experience.

Write from the end user's perspective. Name things by what users will understand in simple language, not by how the system is built. A user manages notifications, not webhook config. Describe what something is or does in plain terms rather than selling it. Being specific and legible to new users is always better than being clever.

Use active voice as default. A CTA says exactly what happens when it is used: "Save changes," not "Submit." An action keeps the same name through the whole flow, so the button that says "Publish" produces a toast that says "Published." The vocabulary of an interface is the signposting for someone navigating the product. Cohesion and consistency are how people learn their way around.

Treat failure and emptiness as moments for direction, not mood. Explain what went wrong and how to fix it, in the interface's voice rather than a person's. Errors don't apologize, and they are never vague about what happened. An empty screen is an invitation to act.

Keep the tone conversational: plain verbs, sentence case, no filler, with tone matched to the brand and the audience. Let each written element do exactly one job.
